# Feedback tips

Writing a good course feedback is just like having a conversation with a friend.
Talk about what really mattered to you and what you would like to know before taking the course!

You can be 100% honest and blunt, your review will always be anonymous!
The more real and specific you are, the more you help other students!

## Not sure what to talk about?

Don't worry, we've been there! Here are some ideas:

- **Professors:** How did you like them? How helpful and available were they? Were they engaging during lectures? Were they fair in their evaluation?
- **Workload:** Was the workload manageable? If not, what consumed most of your time?
- **Lectures:** How useful were they? Were they engaging or boring?
- **Course Content:** How up-to-date was the course material? How relevant and useful was the content for your future career or studies? Did the content match the course description?
- Do you have any pro-tips to share with your colleagues?
- If you went back in time, would you take this course again? Why?
