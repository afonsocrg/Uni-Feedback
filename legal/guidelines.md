# Feedback Guidelines

* **Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

These are the official posting guidelines ("Site Guidelines") for Uni Feedback ("Site”). The Site is owned, operated and/or provided by Afonso Gonçalves ("Uni Feedback" "we," "us," or "our") and these Site Guidelines are a part of, and an Additional Terms under, our [Terms of Service](/terms).

Uni Feedback is a website for students to research and rate university courses in Lisbon.
Our mission is to provide a safe place to share classroom experiences to help fellow students make critical education choices.

## The Site

The Uni Feedback website ([www.uni-feedback.com](www.uni-feedback.com)) provides user generated feedback on university courses.

Course feedback should only be posted by users who have taken or are currently taking that course.
Users are limited to posting one (1) feedback for each course they attended.

Uni Feedback is NOT the place to report dangerous, illegal or illicit behaviors.
If you believe that you, another professor, or a student is in danger, we strongly advise you to report such incidences directly to your campus authorities or local law enforcement.

## How We Work

Uni Feedback has a team of moderators who read every feedback submitted.
We have defined guidelines to help reinforce our mission and most importantly to ensure our decisions around moderation are 100% consistent, regardless of student or professor.
Our moderators are experts on our guidelines and will remove any comment that doesn’t comply.

Did we miss something? If you feel an inappropriate comment should be removed from the site, we want to know.
You can flag a feedback for re-review and it will immediately be escalated to our moderators.
Moderators will determine whether to remove the feedback permanently or restore it to the website.
Our moderators will never edit a submission to make it comply or remove a feedback simply because it is a low score or negative.


## Guidelines

### Student Guidelines
* Be honest in your feedback. You want to be able to trust this feedback when evaluating your course options, so we ask that to contribute in the same spirit.
* When you are giving feedback, it’s often helpful to provide both pros and cons. This leads to much more credible and constructive feedback for your peers.
* Feedback should focus specifically on the course and your learning experience. Do not comment on a Professor’s appearance, dress, age, gender or race.
* Avoid hearsay. We want you to share your individual experience and what you took away from the course. Don’t speak on behalf of another, encourage others to submit their own feedback.
* This is not a forum for debate. Feedback that specifically references another review will be removed. If you do not agree with someone’s individual experience, we encourage you to share your own.
* We understand that not all teachers are the perfect match for each individual learning style. Tell us how the course or professor wasn’t the best *for you* in a way that *helps others make their own decision*.
* Feedbacks fueled by anger do not reflect well on the author and can be removed for violations such as profanity. Take a minute to step back and make sure your review will genuinely help others understand your experience.
* Uni Feedback reserves the right to remove feedback that does not contain substantive comments.
* Students can submit at most one feedback per course. Spamming or dogpiling an account will lead to comment removal and the account being temporarily locked on the site.
* When reading feedback from other students, we encourage you to use your discretion and weigh every feedback amongst the others. Online reviews should be one of the many resources used when making a decision that affects your academic future.

**Prohibited Content**: Comments that contain the following will be removed:

* Profanity, name-calling, and/or vulgarity, derogatory remarks about religion, ethnicity or race, gender, physical appearance, age, mental and/or physical disabilities;
* Identifiable information about a professor or student that would allow someone to contact the professor/student outside of their school;
* Plagiarized content or near-exact matches of existing feedback.
* Submissions generated primarily by AI that *lack personal, authentic experience*.
* Claims about a professor's employment status, including previous employment;
* Claims that a professor or student engages or has engaged in illegal activities;
* Direct references to other existing comments or comments that have been deleted by our moderators;
* A language other than English or Portuguese. Comments must be written either in English or Portuguese.

#### University Guidelines
* This is an anonymous website where students can share their classroom experiences. We are unable to provide any data or personal information about the submitter of a review.
* We are unable to remove a comment simply because it is negative. It will only be removed if it doesn’t comply with our site guidelines.
* Uni Feedback's moderation team is unable to prove or disprove details mentioned in a review. We are not arbiters of facts.
* While it is against our guidelines for non-students to rate university courses, we recommend teachers to encourage their students to give feedback to their courses each semester. The more feedback the course has, the more representative they will be.

## Flagging a Feedback
If you see a feedback that you believe violates these Site Guidelines, please click the "report this rating" at the bottom of the comment and state the problem. Such comments will be evaluated by the Uni Feedback team. Please do not flag a rating just because you disagree with it.
